# IOS Project 2 tests

## How to use

This repository contains a test script for the 2nd IOS project.

First clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/galloj/ios_proj2_test`.
Then you should create a symbolic link to the script `ln -s ./ios_proj2_test/test.py`.
This will work if you cloned the tests into same repository as your project, otherwise you need to change the path accordingly.

The tests can be launched using `python3 test.py` or `./test.py`.
If you choose the latter, you may need to first run `chmod +x test.py`.
